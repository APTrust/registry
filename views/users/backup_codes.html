<h1>Backup Codes</h1>

<p>Please copy the backup codes below. You can use these for two-factor login when you don't have access to Authy or text messages. These backup codes supersede all previously-generated codes.</p>

<!--
     Note that two_factor_controller_test.go looks for these span tags
     to extract backup codes during testing.

{{ range $index, $code := .backupCodes }}
  <span class="backup-code">{{ $code }}</span> <br />

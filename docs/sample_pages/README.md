# Sample Pages

These pages show the existing barebones layout of various Registry pages. They are meant to show what information appears on various pages.

Take a look at the underlying HTML. It is clean and simple for now.

Notice that list pages include a large number of filters. These should not take up so much space at the top of each list. 

* [Alert Detail Page](AlertDetail.html) displays a single alert.
* [Dashboard](Dashboard.html) is the page users see after logging in. It displays recent work items and alerts.
* [Object Detail Page](ObjectDetail.html) displays information about an Intellectual Object (which is a logical collection of files), the files that make up that object, and PREMIS events (audit trail info) describing actions taken on the object.
* [User List](UserList.html) displays a list of users.
* [New User Page](UserNew.html) displays a form for creating a new user.
* [Work Items List](WorkItems.html) displays a list of Work Items along with several filters.

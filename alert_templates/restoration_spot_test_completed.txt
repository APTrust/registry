Hello from APTrust,

We just restored an intellectual object as part of your institution's periodic "restoration spot test."

The point of this exercise is to ensure that when we restore objects you've deposited:

- they come back whole, with all expected files intact, and 
- you can make sense of their contents, and 
- if you need to import restored item into a local DAMS or repository, you can do it 

The restored object, {{ .ItemName }}, is now in your restoration bucket at:

{{ .RestorationURL }}

To download this object, you'll need your S3 credentials an S3 client such as Minio (https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide.html) or APTrust's Partner Tools (https://aptrust.github.io/userguide/partner_tools/).

Your institution runs spot tests every {{ .SpotTestDays }} days. institutional admins can change this by logging into the Registry at {{ .RegistryURL }} and changing the spot test frequency on your institution page. You can turn off spot tests entirely by setting the frequency to zero.

If you have questions, please contact us at help@aptrust.org.

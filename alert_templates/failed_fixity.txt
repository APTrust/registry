Hello from APTrust,

During routine integrity checks on your deposited content, we detected one or more failures in the fixity checks. These checks were run between {{ .StartDate }} and {{ .EndDate }} and are part of our regular monitoring to ensure the long-term integrity of your data.

You can review the full list of affected files at this link: {{ .AlertURL }}

Fixity check failures can occur for various reasons and do not always indicate data loss. We encourage you to review the files in question. To help guide you through that process, weâ€™ve provided more details in our documentation at https://aptrust.github.io/userguide/preservation/recovery/.

If you have any questions or would like assistance with further investigation, please feel free to reach out at help@aptrust.org.

Thank you,
The APTrust Team

# NSQ_URL is the URL for pushing items into work queues.
#
# To queue an item, we post a WorkItem ID to {NSQ_URL}/pub?topic=topic_name
# The WorkItem ID is the body of the POST request.
#
# Note that NSQ typically runs on port 4151, and it runs a lookup daemon
# on port 4161 and a Web UI on port 4171. We just need 4151 for pushing
# items into queues.
